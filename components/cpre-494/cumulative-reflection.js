      {'Iowa State has prepared me very well for the many challenges that await me as I move into the work force. ' +
        'Obviously, the courses I’ve have given me technical knowledge I didn’t have before like how to design a processor, ' +
        'read a circuit diagram, or work on a software development team. ' +
        'But the technical knowledge I’ve gained is worth very little compared to the problem-solving skills I got ' +
        'from that technical knowledge. ' +
        'Wherever I work will have new to me technical tools that I will need to relearn and working at a company ' +
        'can give me that knowledge very easily. ' +
        'What a company cannot give me is the skill to learn something new, ' +
        'and the practice I got in my courses has been indispensable for that.'}
    </p>
    <p>
      {'I also believe that a large part of my learning at Iowa State has been done outside of the classroom. ' +
        'Sure, being forced into teams to do projects helps my collaboration and communication skills. ' +
        'But having to solve real communication problems with my college friends about our living situation ' +
        'has taught me much more about working in a team. I have also learned to value looking outside of my ' +
        'major to learn new things and grow myself in more ways than one. ' +
        'Many of the classes I’ve enjoyed the most have been in subjects completely new to me or completely outside ' +
        'of my main area of study. Courses like Innovations in Chocolate, Beer, Wine and Spirits, Percussion Ensemble, ' +
        'and weightlifting have given me the courage to try new things and interact with different people. ' +
        'Having done that already I know that lifelong learning is important because I never know what ' +
        'new lessons and tricks, I might learn that I can bring to other areas of my life to improve it.'}

      {'In solving problems and complete class assignments I’ve pulled from almost every outside resource I can think of. ' +
        'Often professors give enough information to complete assignments but if they don’t it’s my responsibility ' +
        'as an engineer to solve the problems placed in front of me in any way possible. ' +
        'I most often consult the internet for additional knowledge for completing a task, ' +
        'but I have also found success in conferring with other students or industry professionals that know more than I. ' +
        'Doing this help me to absorb new information directly from a source that can vouch for its importance.'}

    <p>
      {'In my courses I have had to continuously update my professional and technical skills. ' +
        'At each level of growth throughout my education there was a bump in expectations and skill that I had to be ready for. ' +
        'Almost every year I had to take a new class that used C as programming language. ' +
        'And the expectation got higher every year even though my skills didn’t. ' +
        'This pushed me into having to seek help from resources outside the class to improve my understand ' +
        'of the language and keep building upon my prior knowledge. ' +
        'I know that building on my current skills and learning new ones will be a necessity in the ' +
        'workforce because even if I don’t learn anything more after college, ' +
        'others around me still will and new graduates will come out of school knowing more ' +
        'than me so I will have to put in the work to continue growing and learning to match the pace around me.'}
    </p>
    <p>
      {'In my time at Iowa State, I think I did an excellent job in broadening my educational horizons and ' +
        'taking advantage of every learning opportunity in front of me no matter how strange it may have seemed at the time. ' +
        'Because of this I wouldn’t do anything differently if I had to do my undergraduate work again. ' +
        'If anything, I would try and be more diverse with the topics I learned about which would be me pinpoint ' +
        'even better where my best strengths and interests lie.'}
